### k8s书写yaml文件的技巧
#### 1、所有资源类型的内容，没有必要完全背下来，使用kubectl explain XXXX.XXXX即可
##### 1.1 查看deployment资源所需要的字段
```shell script
[root@k8s-master01 test-yaml]# kubectl explain deployment
KIND:     Deployment
VERSION:  apps/v1

DESCRIPTION:
     Deployment enables declarative updates for Pods and ReplicaSets.

FIELDS:
   apiVersion   <string>
     APIVersion defines the versioned schema of this representation of an
     object. Servers should convert recognized schemas to the latest internal
     value, and may reject unrecognized values. More info:
     https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#resources

   kind <string>
     Kind is a string value representing the REST resource this object
     represents. Servers may infer this from the endpoint the client submits
     requests to. Cannot be updated. In CamelCase. More info:
     https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#types-kinds

   metadata     <Object>
     Standard object metadata.

   spec <Object>
     Specification of the desired behavior of the Deployment.

   status       <Object>
     Most recently observed status of the Deployment.
```
##### 1.2 查看deployment中spec字段所需要的信息
```shell script
[root@k8s-master01 test-yaml]# kubectl explain deployment.spec
KIND:     Deployment
VERSION:  apps/v1

RESOURCE: spec <Object>

DESCRIPTION:
     Specification of the desired behavior of the Deployment.

     DeploymentSpec is the specification of the desired behavior of the
     Deployment.

FIELDS:
   minReadySeconds      <integer>
     Minimum number of seconds for which a newly created pod should be ready
     without any of its container crashing, for it to be considered available.
     Defaults to 0 (pod will be considered available as soon as it is ready)

   paused       <boolean>
     Indicates that the deployment is paused.

   progressDeadlineSeconds      <integer>
     The maximum time in seconds for a deployment to make progress before it is
     considered to be failed. The deployment controller will continue to process
     failed deployments and a condition with a ProgressDeadlineExceeded reason
     will be surfaced in the deployment status. Note that progress will not be
     estimated during the time a deployment is paused. Defaults to 600s.

   replicas     <integer>
     Number of desired pods. This is a pointer to distinguish between explicit
     zero and not specified. Defaults to 1.

   revisionHistoryLimit <integer>
     The number of old ReplicaSets to retain to allow rollback. This is a
     pointer to distinguish between explicit zero and not specified. Defaults to
     10.

   selector     <Object> -required-
     Label selector for pods. Existing ReplicaSets whose pods are selected by
     this will be the ones affected by this deployment. It must match the pod
     template's labels.

   strategy     <Object>
     The deployment strategy to use to replace existing pods with new ones.

   template     <Object> -required-
     Template describes the pods that will be created.
```
#### 2、数据类型
##### 2.1 string
```shell script
例如kind和apiVersion都是string类型
```
```shell script
apiVersion: v1  #api版本
kind: Pod       #创建的资源
```
##### 2.2 integer
```shell script
整形，大部分跟时间有关
```
```shell script
deployment.spec下面的minReadySeconds，progressDeadlineSeconds
```
##### 2.3 object，对象，就是里面还有一层，如metadata和labels字段
```shell script
metadata:    
  name: tomcat-test  #Pod的名字
  namespace: default   #Pod所在的名称空间
  labels:
    app:  tomcat     #Pod具有的标签
```
##### 2.4 []object，对象列表，如pod.spec的containers，需要用"-"来缩紧
```shell script
[root@k8s-master01 ~]#  kubectl explain pod.spec       
KIND:     Pod
VERSION:  v1

RESOURCE: spec <Object>

DESCRIPTION:
     Specification of the desired behavior of the pod. More info:
     https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#spec-and-status

     PodSpec is a description of a pod.

FIELDS:
   activeDeadlineSeconds        <integer>
     Optional duration in seconds the pod may be active on the node relative to
     StartTime before the system will actively try to mark it failed and kill
     associated containers. Value must be a positive integer.

   affinity     <Object>
     If specified, the pod's scheduling constraints

   automountServiceAccountToken <boolean>
     AutomountServiceAccountToken indicates whether a service account token
     should be automatically mounted.

   containers   <[]Object> -required-
     List of containers belonging to the pod. Containers cannot currently be
     added or removed. There must be at least one container in a Pod. Cannot be
     updated.
```
```shell script
[root@xianchaomaster1 ~]# vim pod-tomcat.yaml
apiVersion: v1  #api版本
kind: Pod       #创建的资源
metadata:    
  name: tomcat-test  #Pod的名字
  namespace: default   #Pod所在的名称空间
  labels:
    app:  tomcat     #Pod具有的标签
spec:
  containers:
  - name:  tomcat-java   #Pod里容器的名字
    ports:
    - containerPort: 8080  #容器暴露的端口
    image: tomcat-8.5-jre8  #容器使用的镜像
  imagePullPolicy: IfNotPresent    #镜像拉取策略
```
