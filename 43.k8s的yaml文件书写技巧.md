### k8s书写yaml文件的技巧
#### 1、所有资源类型的内容，没有必要完全背下来，使用kubectl explain XXXX.XXXX即可
##### 1.1 查看deployment资源所需要的字段
```shell
[root@k8s-master01 test-yaml]# kubectl explain deployment
KIND:     Deployment
VERSION:  apps/v1

DESCRIPTION:
     Deployment enables declarative updates for Pods and ReplicaSets.

FIELDS:
   apiVersion   <string>
     APIVersion defines the versioned schema of this representation of an
     object. Servers should convert recognized schemas to the latest internal
     value, and may reject unrecognized values. More info:
     https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#resources

   kind <string>
     Kind is a string value representing the REST resource this object
     represents. Servers may infer this from the endpoint the client submits
     requests to. Cannot be updated. In CamelCase. More info:
     https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#types-kinds

   metadata     <Object>
     Standard object metadata.

   spec <Object>
     Specification of the desired behavior of the Deployment.

   status       <Object>
     Most recently observed status of the Deployment.
```
##### 1.2 查看deployment中spec字段所需要的信息
```shell
[root@k8s-master01 test-yaml]# kubectl explain deployment.spec
KIND:     Deployment
VERSION:  apps/v1

RESOURCE: spec <Object>

DESCRIPTION:
     Specification of the desired behavior of the Deployment.

     DeploymentSpec is the specification of the desired behavior of the
     Deployment.

FIELDS:
   minReadySeconds      <integer>
     Minimum number of seconds for which a newly created pod should be ready
     without any of its container crashing, for it to be considered available.
     Defaults to 0 (pod will be considered available as soon as it is ready)

   paused       <boolean>
     Indicates that the deployment is paused.

   progressDeadlineSeconds      <integer>
     The maximum time in seconds for a deployment to make progress before it is
     considered to be failed. The deployment controller will continue to process
     failed deployments and a condition with a ProgressDeadlineExceeded reason
     will be surfaced in the deployment status. Note that progress will not be
     estimated during the time a deployment is paused. Defaults to 600s.

   replicas     <integer>
     Number of desired pods. This is a pointer to distinguish between explicit
     zero and not specified. Defaults to 1.

   revisionHistoryLimit <integer>
     The number of old ReplicaSets to retain to allow rollback. This is a
     pointer to distinguish between explicit zero and not specified. Defaults to
     10.

   selector     <Object> -required-
     Label selector for pods. Existing ReplicaSets whose pods are selected by
     this will be the ones affected by this deployment. It must match the pod
     template's labels.

   strategy     <Object>
     The deployment strategy to use to replace existing pods with new ones.

   template     <Object> -required-
     Template describes the pods that will be created.
